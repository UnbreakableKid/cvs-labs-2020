    This is the first lab assignment for the Construction and Verification of
    Software of the integrated master in computer science and engineering
    (MIEI) http://www.di.fct.unl.pt/miei

    The piazza page where you can discuss solutions and problems related to
    this lab class is at: https://piazza.com/class/jt9v3bajo03e3#

    Your mission is to complete all methods below using dafny. Completely 
    specify the methods by writing the weakest pre-condition and the strongest
    post-condition possible. Implement and verify the methods according to that
    same specification.

    This is a test method just to check if dafny is working properly.

    Notice that dafny is capable of deriving general logical properties
    about integer values.

/**
    In Dafny, functions consist of one expression (usually an if then else) and are not compiled.
    As such, it is not possible to call them in methods' bodies; it is only possible to use
    functions in specifications.

    Functions usually inductively define some method we are trying to prove correct. Despite
    inefficient, in some cases, it is easier to define recursive algorithms. This way, we can
    check the correctness of an iterative algorithm against its recursive definition.

    The use of functions enables simpler specifications which are less likely to be
    wrong.

    This function has one case base which is:
        sumallpositive(0) == 0

        sumallpositive(n) == n + summallpositive(n - 1)
