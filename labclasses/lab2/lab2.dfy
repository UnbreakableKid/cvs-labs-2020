    Software of the integrated master in computer science and engineering
    (MIEI) http://www.di.fct.unl.pt/miei

    The piazza page where you can discuss solutions and problems related to
    this lab class is at: https://piazza.com/class/jt9v3bajo03e3#

    Your mission is to complete all methods below using dafny. Completely 
    specify the methods by writing the weakest pre-condition and the strongest
    post-condition possible. Implement and verify the methods according to that
    same specification.

    Functions usually inductively define some method we are trying to prove correct. Despite
    inefficient, in some cases, it is easier to define recursive algorithms. This way, we can
    check the correctness of an iterative algorithm against its recursive definition.

    wrong.
