Dafny is a programming language developed by Microsoft Research; it has built-in specification constructs which allow for the static formal verification of programs functional correctness (the programs do what they are supposed to do) the code produced.  To specify a Dafny program, it is necessary to define the methods' preconditions and postconditions. Assuming the preconditions of a method, Dafny will try to prove then postconditions based on the method's body; if it cannot prove the postconditions, then the program is not correct since it does not comply with its specification.

Lab 4:	

* For each unimplemented method in the __lab4.dfy__ file start by defining the most relaxed preconditions and the most strict postconditions you can think of, then implement the method according to the conditions. Afterwards, proceed to implement the class SavingsAccount in __SavingsAccount.dfy__.
